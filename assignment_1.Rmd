##STATISCAL MODELLING

#Bike Seoul Model

bike_seoul$LoggedCount<-log(bike_seoul$Count)
#log count as outcome

seoul_model<-lm(LoggedCount~Season+Temperature+Humidity+WindSpeed,data=bike_seoul)
#predictors are season, temperature, humidity windspeed
summary(seoul_model)
#It shows that the predictors Autumn, Winter, Temperature, 
#Humidity and windspeed, have significance.
#Therefore, rejects the null hypothesis, of them being equal to zero.

confint(seoul_model,level = 0.97)
#97% confidence intervals for the estimated regression co-efficients, 
#they are reliable as sample size is large 8465 and there have low variance.

df_pred<-data.frame(Season="Winter",Temperature=0,WindSpeed=0.5,Humidity=20)
#values for the model's prediction to be based upon.

predict(seoul_model,newdata = df_pred)
#5.913 bikes rented in Seoul

predict(seoul_model,newdata = df_pred,interval = "prediction",level = 0.90)
#Therefore, we are (90%) confident with the given parameters, 
#would at least rent 4.55 bikes and at maximum 7.28 bikes.

#Bike Washington Model
bike_washington$LoggedCount<-log(bike_washington$Count)
washington_model<-lm(LoggedCount~Season+Temperature+Humidity+WindSpeed,data=bike_washington)

summary(washington_model)
#In Washington the predictors, Summer,Autumn, Winter, temperature, 
#Humidity and Wind speed all have significance, 
#rejecting the null hypothesis of them being zero.

confint(washington_model,level = 0.97)
#As we have quite a large sample size of 17379, 
#the confidence intervals for the co-efficient are reliable and low variance. 

predict(washington_model,newdata = df_pred)
#3.64 bikes rented in Washington

predict(washington_model,newdata = df_pred,interval = "prediction",level = 0.90)
#Therefore, we are (90%) confident with the given parameters,
#would at least rent 1.55 bikes and at maximum 5.71 bikes.

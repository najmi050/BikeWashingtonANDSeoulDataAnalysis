## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#importing tidyverse for cleaning our data
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
#reading csv file for bikeseoul dataset
bike_seoul <- read_csv('BikeSeoul.csv')
#viewing the dataset's appearance.
summary(bike_seoul)
head(bike_seoul)
bike_seoul[bike_seoul$`Functioning Day` == 'Yes', ]
filter(bike_seoul, `Functioning Day` == 'No')


bike_seoul <-
  bike_seoul %>% select(
    -starts_with("Visibility"),
    -starts_with("Dew"),
    -starts_with("Solar"),
    -starts_with("Rain"),
    -starts_with("Snow")
  ) %>%#removing columns for visibility, dew point temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and snowfall.
  filter(`Rented Bike Count` != 0) %>% #filtering out where no data was collected for bike count
  select(-'Functioning Day') %>% #removing functioning day column
  rename(Date = Date, Count = "Rented Bike Count",Hour = "Hour",Temperature = "Temperature(C)",Humidity = "Humidity(%)",
    WindSpeed = "Wind speed (m/s)",Season = "Seasons", Holiday = "Holiday") %>% #renaming columns
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, tryFormats = c("%d-%m-%Y", "%d/%m/%Y"))) %>%# Converting Date to date object
  mutate(FullDate = make_datetime(day = day(Date),month = month(Date),year = year(Date),hour = Hour)) %>% #a new column is added, called FullDate which includes the hour in it
  mutate(Holiday = factor(Holiday,levels = c('Holiday', 'No Holiday'),labels = c('Yes', 'No'))) %>% #Holiday fator level changed to Yes/No
  mutate(Season = factor(Season, levels = c("Spring", "Summer", 'Autumn', 'Winter')))#Factor order level changed for Season as specified i.e Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter

bike_washington<-read_csv('BikeWashingtonDC.csv')
summary(bike_washington)
colnames(bike_washington)
bike_washington<-bike_washington%>%#Removing columns: instant, yr, mnth, weekday, workingday, weathersit, atemp, casual and registered users
  select(-"instant",-"yr",-"mnth",
         -"weekday",-"workingday",
         -"weathersit",-"atemp",-"casual",-"registered")%>%
  rename(Date = 'dteday',Count = "cnt", Hour = "hr",Temperature = "temp", Humidity = "hum" )%>%
  rename( WindSpeed = "windspeed",Season = "season", Holiday = "holiday" )%>%#renaming columns
  mutate(Season = factor(Season, levels = c("1", "2", '3', '4'),labels = c("Winter","Spring","Summer","Autumn")))%>%#changing factor levels of seasons
  mutate(Season = factor(Season, levels = c("Spring", "Summer", 'Autumn', 'Winter')))%>%#ordering them the same way as in seoul dataset
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, tryFormats = c("%d-%m-%Y", "%d/%m/%Y")))%>% #converting date to date object
  mutate(Holiday = factor(Holiday,levels = c('Holiday', 'No Holiday'),labels = c('Yes', 'No')))%>%
  mutate(FullDate = make_datetime(day = day(Date),month = month(Date),year = year(Date),hour = Hour))#adding Fulldate column
bike_washington$Humidity<-sapply(bike_washington$Humidity,function(vec,n){return(vec*n) },n=100)#scaling humidity by multiplying it by 100
bike_washington$WindSpeed<-sapply(bike_washington$WindSpeed,function(vec,n){return(vec*n)},n=(67000/(60*60)))#scaling windspeed by multiplying it by 67000/3600(67km/hr) to get it in m/s
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

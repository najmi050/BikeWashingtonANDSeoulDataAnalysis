## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#importing tidyverse for cleaning our data
library(tidyverse)
#reading csv file for bikeseoul dataset
bike_seoul<-read_csv('BikeSeoul.csv')
#viewing the dataset.
summary(bike_seoul)
head(bike_seoul)
bike_seoul[bike_seoul$`Functioning Day`=='Yes',]
filter(bike_seoul,`Functioning Day`=='No')
#removing columns for visibility, dew point temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and snowfall.
bike_seoul<-bike_seoul%>%select(-starts_with("Visibility"),-starts_with("Dew"),-starts_with("Solar"),-starts_with("Rain"),-starts_with("Snow"))%>%
  filter(`Rented Bike Count` !=0)%>%#filtering out where no data was collected for bike count
  select(-'Functioning Day')%>%#removing functioning day column
rename(Date=Date,Count="Rented Bike Count", Hour="Hour",Temperature="Temperature(C)",
       Humidity ="Humidity(%)",WindSpeed="Wind speed (m/s)",Season="Seasons",Holiday="Holiday")#renaming columns
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
